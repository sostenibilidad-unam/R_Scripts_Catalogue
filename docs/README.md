# R scripts for Research on Sustainability

 Author: Dra. Yosune Miquelajauregui Graf
 
 This digital repository contains R scripts which have been developed for LANCIS, UNAM. 

 All scripts are property of LANCIS.
 [R Scripts Catalogue](http://lancis.ecologia.unam.mx/R_Scripts_Catalogue/)



This catalogue is divided in two sections. The first section contains a collection of scripts which were developed to   manipulate, analyze and visualize data used for sustainability reserach. The second section is composed of scripts developed to perform statistical analyses and to implement mathematical models of socioecological systems.
